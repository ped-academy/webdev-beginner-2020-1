    <p>Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.</p>
    <p>The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled
        it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and
        even bikinis. One thing they never discovered though was the number
        zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits
        slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with
        is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date
        their programmes.</p>
    <p>The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice
        these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack
        into stone tablets).</p>
    <pre>
        1  =&gt; I
        10  =&gt; X
        7  =&gt; VII
    </pre>
    <p>There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000.
        (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)</p>
    <p>Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each
        digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any
        digit with a value of zero.</p>
    <p>In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC: 1000=M 900=CM 90=XC</p>
    <p>In Roman numerals 2008 is MMVIII: 2000=MM 8=VIII</p>
