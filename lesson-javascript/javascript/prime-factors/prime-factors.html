    <h1>Prime Factors</h1>
    <h3>Use console to test results.</h3>
    <p>Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.</p>
    <p>A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.</p>
    <p>Note that 1 is not a prime number.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>What are the prime factors of 60?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.</li>
        <li>2 goes into 30, leaving 15.
            <ul>
                <li>2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.
            <ul>
                <li>3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.</li>
                <li>4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>5 does go cleanly into 5.</li>
        <li>We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime
        factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.</p>
    <p>You can check this yourself:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 * 2 * 3 * 5</li>
        <li>= 4 * 15</li>
        <li>= 60</li>
        <li>Success!</li>
    </ul>
