    <h1>Robot Simulator</h1>
    <h3>Use console to test results.</h3>
    <p>Write a robot simulator.</p>
    <p>A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.</p>
    <p>The robots have three possible movements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>turn right</li>
        <li>turn left</li>
        <li>advance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular
        direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
        e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.</p>
    <p>The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the
        testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which
        direction it is pointing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
            <ul>
                <li>Turn right</li>
                <li>Advance twice</li>
                <li>Turn left</li>
                <li>Advance once</li>
                <li>Turn left yet again</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream
            of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Expected input:</b></p>
    <pre>
        robot.place({ x: 7, y: 3, direction: 'north' });
        robot.move('RAALAL');
    </pre>
    <p><b>Expected output:</b></p>
    <pre>
        Placed at: {x: 7, y: 3, direction: "north"}
        Moved to (R): {x: 7, y: 3, direction: "east"}
        Moved to (A): {x: 8, y: 3, direction: "east"}
        Moved to (A): {x: 9, y: 3, direction: "east"}
        Moved to (L): {x: 9, y: 3, direction: "north"}
        Moved to (A): {x: 9, y: 4, direction: "north"}
        Moved to (L): {x: 9, y: 4, direction: "west"}
